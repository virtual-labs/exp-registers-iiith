      "question": "1. How many iterations does an N input PIPO shift register take to reset the inputs to its original location?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "N",
        "b": "N/2",
        "c": "log(N)",
        "d": "N*N"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. In a PIPO shift register, each input is shifted by one position in each clock cycle. To reset the inputs to their original location, all N inputs need to go through N clock cycles.",
        "b": "Incorrect. In a PIPO shift register, each clock cycle shifts the inputs by one position. If only N/2 iterations were performed, the inputs would not return to their original location.",
        "c": "Incorrect. In the context of resetting the inputs of a PIPO shift register, it is not possible to achieve the desired result in log(N) iterations.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This suggests a quadratic relationship between the number of inputs and the number of iterations, which is not applicable in this case."

      "question": "2. How many clock cycles are required to serially move an input right by 3 places?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "3",
        "b": "4",
        "c": "2",
        "d": "1"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. To move the input right by 3 places in a serial shift register, exactly 3 clock cycles are required. The shift from input to the first register is part of the shifting operation, not a separate step.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This would be counting the input-to-register transfer as a separate operation, which is incorrect. Only 3 clock cycles are needed.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Two clock cycles would only move the input right by 2 places, not 3 places.",
        "d": "Incorrect. One clock cycle would only move the input right by 1 place, not 3 places."

      "question": "3. What is the full form of PIPO?",

        "c": "Parallel In Serial Out",
        "d": "Parallel Input Parallel Output"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. PIPO stands for Parallel In Parallel Out, which refers to a type of register where data is loaded and read in parallel.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The full form of SIPO is Serial In Parallel Out.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The full form of PISO is Parallel In Serial Out.",

      "question": "4. If I1=1, I2=1, I3=0, I4=1 in a PIPO register, then what is the output of the 3rd flip flop after 2 clock cycles?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "1",
        "b": "0",
        "c": "I1",
        "d": "Both a and c"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. In a PIPO register, data is loaded and stored in parallel, not shifted. The 3rd flip flop retains its original value.",
        "b": "Correct. In a PIPO (Parallel In, Parallel Out) register, data is loaded in parallel and remains stable until new data is loaded. The 3rd flip flop maintains its initial value of 0.",
        "c": "Incorrect. In a PIPO register, there is no shifting operation. Each flip flop maintains its loaded value independently.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Option c is incorrect because PIPO registers do not perform shifting operations between flip flops."
