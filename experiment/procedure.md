1. Firstly learn everything from the 'Demo' section.
2. Then, test your understanding about Latch and Flip Flops in the 'Pretest' section.
3. Then in the 'Practice' section in the task-1 "Serial Register", make simple SISO Register using logic gates and D flip-flops and test it with time-varying clock input.
4. After that, in task-2 "Parallel Register" make a PIPO load register using logic gates and D flip-flops and test it with time-varying clock input.
5. Finally, test your understanding of the experiment in the 'Posttest' section.
