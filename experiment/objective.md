The objective of this experiment is to design and analyze different register circuits. You will be able to design basic storage registers, shift registers, and counter circuits.

- **Basic Storage Registers**: Design fundamental data storage circuits using flip-flops
- **Shift Registers**: Implement serial-in-serial-out, serial-in-parallel-out, parallel-in-serial-out, and parallel-in-parallel-out shift registers
- **Counter Circuits**: Construct synchronous and asynchronous counters using register configurations

Through this experiment, students will gain practical experience in sequential circuit design and understand the fundamental principles of data storage, manipulation, and transfer in digital hardware systems.
